Hello everyone!

Today, we have just unveiled our shiny new site! There is still work to be done, but it's a big step
in making this a viable piece of software. On this new site, you will be able to view status on
Geyser, update logs, and any projects we may start up in the future.

We hope to eventually set up a system where users using Geyser can post their server
and showcase it. As of now, Geyser is still a work in progress and only parts of it are complete.

Within the coming weeks, we hope to finish inventory support (with proper mappings), start on entities,
work on chunk support set up a proper doc system. I hope you guys are as excited as I am to get this
project off the ground and finally in a working place!
